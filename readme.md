title: "🛰️ Drift Watch"
description: >
  Drift Watch is a lightweight system that monitors, compares, and calibrates distributed AI "canaries"
  to detect model drift or unexpected behavior over time.
  Designed for experiments in self-healing AI and model integrity validation.

features:
  - name: "Canary Network"
    description: "Deploy multiple fine-tuned micro-models to watch for behavioral drift."
  - name: "Drift Injection"
    description: "Simulate adversarial changes to test model stability."
  - name: "Comparison Engine"
    description: "Evaluate and visualize divergence between canary outputs."
  - name: "Calibration Loop"
    description: "Continuously retrain or rebalance canaries when deviation is detected."
